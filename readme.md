# 🌱 Learning Python

Hey! I'm **Kaustubh Shukla**, a B.Tech CSE (AI/ML) student at **Lovely Professional University**.  
This repository is my personal coding journal — where I practice, experiment, and strengthen my foundation in Python.

---

## 💡 What I’m Doing Here

This repo is all about **learning through practice**.  
Every file is a small step — a simple script, a logic exercise, or a concept I wanted to understand deeply.  
No tutorials, no theory dumps — just me writing, debugging, and learning one `.py` file at a time.

It includes:
- Basic syntax, operators, loops, and conditionals  
- Functions, arguments, and data structures  
- Simple math and logical problems  
- Mini-projects and beginner-friendly utilities  
- Early OOP experiments with classes and objects  

Everything here is raw, practical, and focused on real understanding — not memorization.

---

## 🧭 What’s Inside

You’ll find scripts that:
- Solve small mathematical and logical problems  
- Simulate everyday programs like converters, calculators, and games  
- Introduce OOP concepts gradually through small examples  

It’s structured simply — easy to navigate and run.

## 🚀 What’s Next

I’ll be moving forward into:
- **Data Handling & EDA** using `pandas` and `matplotlib`  
- **Automation scripts** and small productivity tools  
- **Database integration** (SQLite/MySQL)  
- **C programming & DBMS** for my next semester coursework  
- Eventually, **AI/ML foundations** built on this Python base
